1) spreadsheet.js should be modified so that editing a field in spreadsheet sends an XmlHttpRequest 
back to your app to update the field in the database. Data should be sent as JSON, and the controller 
called should be ApiController (use c=api in the url). This should be testable on the Edit Sheet Page.

2) spreadsheet.js should be modified so that when a using clicks on an editable cell rather than a prompt 
being used to get a new value the cell itself should be highlighted and a value can be entered in it 
(more like a traditional spreadsheet like Excel).

3) Currently, cells with expressions like =A1 or =((A1 + B1) * C3) will be evaluated and the value will 
be drawn. spreadsheet.js should be extended to accept expressions like =avg(A1:A10) which would compute 
the average value of A1, A2, ...., A10.
