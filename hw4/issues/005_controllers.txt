1) If on the landing page a user enters a hash_code of type "read", they should be taken to 
the Read Sheet Page and the spreadsheet corresponding to that code should be displayed.

2) If on the landing page, a user enters a hash_code of type "file", the spreadsheet should be 
displayed as an XML file that conforms to the edit given by spreadsheet.dtd. The grader will verify 
this using oXygen.

3) If one enters the Edit Url, Read Url, or File Url's directly in the browser url bar one should 
be taken to the correct page with respect to the current spreadsheet.
