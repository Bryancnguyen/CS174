	- transfer-encoding header is used to describe the method of encoding used to transfer the content to the user.
	- there are several encodings, but in the case of 'chunked' the response is sent over in a series of chunks, with messages containing the size to allow the recipient to know when they've received a wholesome response.

4) ETag: W/"13e41-5454975c08373" (from http response Wikipedia sent) 
	- ETag header is used to validate web caches.
	- the ETag allows the server to send content conditionally, based on whether the user's cached content is valid or not.
	- the ETag header is verified by the server; if the server successfully verifies the header, page content can be rendered from the user's cache
	- the ETag saves bandwidth and increases response time by allowing the server to reduce the size of the response
